Welcome to Cisco Automation Framework's documentation!
======================================================

The Cisco Automation Framework is intended to provide a network administrator or network engineer a single tool
to allow them to write scripts that when run against any Cisco device return consistent output so the author does
not have to account for changes in command syntax or command output.

.. warning:: This documentation is a work in progress and is in no way complete or comprehensive at this time, it
   is being actively developed and more information will come in time.
