Framework
---------


.. py:module:: Framework

.. py:currentmodule:: Framework

.. py:class:: CAF

    .. py:method:: __init__(self, ip, username, password, enable_password=False)

        Connects to the remote device, detects the firmware version, and sets up the framework to issue
        commands based on the firmware detected.

        :param str ip: IP address of remote device
        :param str username: Username to login to remote device
        :param str password: Password to login to remote device
        :param str enable_password: Password to enter privilege exec mode, not required to establish a connection
            because not all commands need to have that privilege level, but if you have the password it is a good idea
            to pass it in


.. py:class:: SSHEngine

    .. py:method:: __init__(self)

    .. py:method:: connect_to_server(self, ip, username, password)

        Connects to Server

        :param str ip: IP address of the remote Server
        :param str username: Username of the user logging in
        :param str password: Password for the user logging in
